# Godot-Small-FPS

![](https://i.imgur.com/2jqKUjU.png)

## Description
A small FPS made with the Godot Engine.<br />
I'm not an expert programmer or Godot user so parts of the code may be silly silly.

## Controls
Use `left mouse button` to fire<br />
Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move<br />
Use `Q` to sprint<br />
Use `left shift` to crouch<br />
Use `space` to jump<br />
Use `left shift + space` to crouch-jump<br />
Use `Esc` to pause (doesn't really pause though)<br />
Use `F11` to toggle fullscreen

I partly modified a script made by turtlewit and Blasterott18 for the player controller:<br />
